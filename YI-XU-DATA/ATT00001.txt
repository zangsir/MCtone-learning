In any case, we are trying some machine learning algorithms on the Mandarin tone data we have, but probably because of the bad quality of our recorded data (it was recorded by someone else and I obtained them), we couldn't really get a good result comparing to Gauthier et al (2007): "Learning phonetic categories by tracking movements".

Or, if sharing the original audio recording is not possible, we wonder if you can share the tone contour data files (maybe in csv file format) with us. It'll greatly help validating our approach since with our previous data, nothing works well to cluster/classify tones (including SOM).

As a preliminary step, we're trying to implement a Bayesian model (categorical perception/perceptual magnet by Naomi Feldman et al), and to try it on tone curves. We thought that it would be nice to be able to represent tone curves by the parameters proposed in qTA. We read this paper of yours:

As I mentioned, our goal is to reduce each tone contour curve to a small number of parameter representations (and possibly to include conditional probabilities given tone context). I would appreciate any suggestions/code you have.
